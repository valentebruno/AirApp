# TestAirApps
This is a Test code for AirApps company
It was done on a old macmini, but I've tried to do the most to the modern SWiftUI code

Approach//
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how I would approach this project:
	
 	1.	Project Setup
 
	  ◦	Create a new Xcode project using SwiftUI
	  ◦	Set up a Git repository for version control
 
	
	 2.	Architecture
    
	  ◦	Implement MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture
	  ◦	Create separate modules for Networking, Models, ViewModels, and Views
	
	 4.	Networking
	  ◦	Create a NetworkManager class to handle API requests
	  ◦	Implement async/await for modern concurrency
	  ◦	Use URLSession for network calls
	  ◦	Create endpoints for State and Nation population data
	
	 5.	Models
	  ◦	Create data models for Population, State, and Nation
	
	 6.	ViewModels
	  ◦	Create a PopulationViewModel to manage data and business logic
	  ◦	Implement error handling and loading states
	
	 7.	Views
	  ◦	Create a main view with a list of population data
	  ◦	Implement a detail view for showing more information
	  ◦	Use SwiftUI components like List, NavigationView, and AsyncImage
	
	 8.	Error Handling
	  ◦	Implement custom error types
	  ◦	Create an error view to display user-friendly error messages
	
	 9.	Testing
	  ◦	Write unit tests for the NetworkManager
	  ◦	Test ViewModels for business logic
	  ◦	Implement UI tests for critical user flows
